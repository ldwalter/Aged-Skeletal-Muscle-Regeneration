# Skeletal muscle regeneration across mouse lifespan

We collected an integrated atlas of 273,923 single-cell transcriptomes and high-resolution spatial transcriptomic maps from muscles of young, old and geriatric mice at multiple time points following myotoxin injury. Here, you'll find the R scripts used for the analysis and visualization of the single-cell RNA-sequencing data (R_scripts/).
